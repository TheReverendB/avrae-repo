An alias for the Staff of Fire

`!sFire "<spell>" [cast arguments] [-i]`. 
 
Creates the counter, casts the spell and uses the counter to keep track. Using `-i`, the wand can be used without expending the charge.
 
You only need to type a unique part of the spell name in order to cast the spell, using quotes for multi-word spells.
 
Examples of how to use the staff:
 
`!sFire "Burning Hands"` or `!sFire burning` will cast Burning Hands using 1 charge
`!sFire "Fireball"` or `!sFire ball` will cast Fireball using 3 charges
`!sFire "Wall of Fire"` or `!sFire wall` will cast Wall of Fire using 4 charges
 
 
This alias will create a counter that recharges 1d6+4 on long rest. 
 
The code behind these aliases will be posted as available on my [Github](https://github.com/TheReverendB/avrae-aliases)
