An alias for using the Grey Bag of Tricks!  It will roll for the animal you pull from the bag.
 
`!greybag`

* Jan 2025 update: The alias will add the monster to combat!
The monster's HP and AC will be visible to help distinguish it from other monsters, and it's name will not be GO#.
(you may need to select the Basic Rules or free-rules version when adding them to combat)
