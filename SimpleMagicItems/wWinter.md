An alias for the Wand of Winter.

`!wWinter "<spell>" [cast arguments] [-i]`. 
 
Creates the counter, casts the spell and uses the counter to keep track. Using `-i`, the wand can be used without expending the charge.
 
You only need to type a unique part of the spell name in order to cast the spell, using quotes for multi-word spells.
Since you can cast Ray of Frost for free or using a charge, it has a unique and easy way to differentiate the levels.
Examples of how to use the wand:
 
`!wWinter "Ray of Frost0"` or `!wWinter frost0` will cast Ray of Frost for free at the lowest level (0 charges, one damage die)
`!wWinter "Ray of Frost1"` or `!wWinter frost1` will cast Ray of Frost 'at level 5' (1 charge, two damage dice)
`!wWinter "Sleet Storm"` or `!wWinter sleet` will cast Sleet Storm using 3 charges
`!wWinter "Ice Storm"` or `!wWinter ice` will cast Ice Storm using 4 charges
 
 
This alias will create a counter that recharges 1d6+1 on long rest. 
 
The code behind these aliases will be posted as available on my [Github](https://github.com/TheReverendB/avrae-aliases)
