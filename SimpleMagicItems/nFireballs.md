An alias for using the Necklace of Fireballs.
 
`!nFireballs roll` 
This will create the counter with a roll to determine the amount of beads on the necklace.  If you already found a Necklace of Fireballs, and rolled for the amount of beads, you can create your own counter, adding the max as needed.  `!cc create "Necklace of Fireballs" -min 0 -max ??`
 
`!nFireballs [charges used] [-t target(s)] [-i]` to target in combat and `-i` to ignore uses
