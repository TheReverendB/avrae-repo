  text: 'This Javelin is a Magic Weapon. When you hurl it and speak its Command Word,
    it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends
    out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in the line excluding
    you and the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning
    damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The Lightning
    Bolt turns back into a Javelin when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon
    Attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the Javelin
    plus 4d6 lightning damage.


    The javelin''s property can''t be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime,
    the Javelin can still be used as a Magic Weapon.'
